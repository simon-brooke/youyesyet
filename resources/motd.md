###   Alpha test code

This is a voter intention information system intended to be used by the 'Yes' side in the next Scottish independence referendum.

Design documentation is [here](https://github.com/simon-brooke/youyesyet/blob/master/doc/specification/userspec.md).

Although addresses in the database mostly are real, all personal data in the database is randomly generated and does not represent real people.
