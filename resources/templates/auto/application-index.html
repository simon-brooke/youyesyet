Dwelling

<p>
All dwellings within addresses in the system; a dwelling is a
      house, flat or appartment in which electors live. Every address should have
      at least one dwelling; essentially, an address maps onto a street door and
      dwellings map onto what's behind that door. So a tenement or a block of flats
      would be one address with many dwellings.
