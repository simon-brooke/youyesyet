A web-app intended to be used by canvassers campaigning for a 'Yes' vote in the second independence referendum.

The web-app will be delivered to canvassers out knocking doors primarily through an HTML5/React single-page app; it's possible that someone else may do an Android of iPhone native app to address the same back end but at present I have no plans for this.

There must also be an administrative interface through which privileged users can set the system up and authorise canvassers, and a 'followup' interface through which issue-expert specialist canvassers can address particular electors' queries.
